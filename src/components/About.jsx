          Hello! My name is Joana Grave, and I am a Full-Stack Engineer
          located in Washington, D.C. For the past ten years, I had been working
          in the hospitality industry, where I gained valuable skills in
          customer service, leadership, and communication. However, despite my
          success in that field, I always felt a nagging desire to explore my
          passion for technology. I decided to pivot toward a career in
          technology, a field that I have always admired. My natural inclination
          towards a technical and systematic approach has made this transition
          into programming an extremely smooth one! This essay is the story of
          my journey from hospitality to technology, and how I leveraged my
          experience and skills to pursue a fulfilling career in programming.
        </p>

          Life to me is about growth, overcoming obstacles, and being better

          forward to connecting with you! Feel free to reach out via LinkedIn,
